## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass, 7-1 architecture
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass (scss) 7-1 architecture
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Github Actions
- Github Pages
- npm / vite

### What I learned

- Continuing my journey to introduce Sass into my workflow.  This time I used a two stage definition of colors, with base colors defined in _variables.scss and a themes/_default.scss to define how the colors are applied in the page.
- Refined my menu a bit and introduced more Sass variables into it.
